## Dropzone
 The drag-and-drop, instant uploading, selfhosted, peer-to-peer file sharing application.

---

Dropzone a small and niche application for people who want to share small to medium size files across the internet.
It's a simple as selecting your files in your favorite file explorer and dragging them into the application.
The files will instantly be online and sharable. It even features a web frontend, where friends and family can download the files or preview them. Larger files like home-movies and music can be streamed right in the web frontend to make downloading easier.

### Downsides
There are some downsides to using Dropzone.
  * Your files will only be online when the application is on (and therefore the host's computer).
  * The download speed is limited by the host's upload speed.
